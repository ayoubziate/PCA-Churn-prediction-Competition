# PCA-Churn-prediction-Competition
## Description
Given a database that contains historical customer orders, we would like to use this database to perform analysis to understand why customers are unsubscribing, and possibly develop a strategy to retain them before they leave. The goal is to create a machine learning model to help us predict customer churn. In concrete terms, the algorithm should be able to predict whether customers will place orders or if they are likely to unsubscribe.
